This project is an inclusive travel and booking webapp built with Next.js, React, TypeScript, and TailwindCSS.  
Its main goal is to allow users (especially people with reduced mobility or disabilities) to find and book hotels, attractions, and transport options that meet accessibility standards.

Follow these conventions across all files and components:

1. **Architecture & Stack**
   - Framework: Next.js (App Router)
   - Language: TypeScript
   - Styling: TailwindCSS + accessible custom components
   - State management: React hooks or lightweight state (no Redux unless required)
   - Folder structure:
     - /components → UI elements (FilterSidebar, HotelCard, SearchBar, etc.)
     - /pages → Next.js routes
     - /lib → utility functions
     - /data → mock or static data (filters, accessibility labels, etc.)

2. **Accessibility (Core Principle)**
   - Every interactive element must include `aria-label`, `role`, and keyboard navigation support.
   - Maintain WCAG 2.1 AA compliance.
   - Prefer semantic HTML (`<main>`, `<aside>`, `<section>`, `<nav>`).
   - Include visual focus states for buttons, inputs, and filters.
   - Filters related to accessibility (e.g., “ramp access”, “elevator”, “braille signage”) must be visually emphasized (icons, color, or badges).

3. **Code Quality**
   - Follow DRY and clean code principles.
   - Use functional components and React hooks.
   - Comment intent above complex logic.
   - Ensure ESLint and Prettier are applied.

4. **Component Format**
   - Always declare components using `const` instead of `export const`.
   - Use `export default` at the end of the component file.
   - Do not use index.ts files for component exports.
   - Import components directly from their file paths.
   - Example format:
     ```tsx
     const ComponentName = () => {
       // component logic
       return (
         // JSX
       )
     }
     
     export default ComponentName
     ```

5. **Performance**
   - Use Next.js Image for optimization.
   - Implement lazy loading for large lists.
   - Use dynamic import for heavy components (e.g., maps).

6. **Internationalization**
   - Default language: Spanish (es-ES)
   - Secondary language: English (en)
   - Use `next-intl` or similar i18n library.

7. **AI Context**
   - When the Agent writes code or explanations, always assume the goal is to make a **visually accessible, inclusive, and intuitive booking experience**.
   - Avoid generic code; apply the project’s accessibility-first design language in every suggestion.
